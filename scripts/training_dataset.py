# This script generates the training_dataset.csv.
# Each row contains statistics for a game and they are sorted by date. Each row consists of 10 scores for the 
# home team and 10 scores for the away team, the outcome, team names and the date. The outcome, names and date 
# are removed in predictor.py. So the training vectors will consist of 20 elements.
